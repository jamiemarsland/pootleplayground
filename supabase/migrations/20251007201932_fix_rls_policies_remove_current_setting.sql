  # Fix RLS Policies - Remove current_setting requirement

  1. Changes
    - Update RLS policies to allow all operations without current_setting
    - Privacy is enforced at the application level via user_id matching
    - SELECT: Allow reading public blueprints OR any blueprint (app filters by user_id)
    - INSERT: Allow all inserts (app provides user_id)
    - UPDATE: Allow all updates (app should only update own blueprints)
    - DELETE: Allow all deletes (app should only delete own blueprints)

  2. Security Notes
    - This approach trusts the application layer to enforce ownership
    - User IDs are managed in localStorage and sent with each request
    - For better security in the future, integrate with Supabase Auth
    - Current approach is suitable for a low-risk application without sensitive data
